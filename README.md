# projectBlog
My latest project, the responsive web app which imitates discussion portal.
As unsigned users we can browse the home page with latest posts, read the comments and view other users' profile pages.
After we sign up we can edit our profile information, add profile image, create new posts and also leave comments to existing entries.
Technologies used: Php (Laravel), Html, Css, PostgreSql, Bootstrap.
